# Stacks and Queues

A stack is a data structure that consists of Nodes. Each Node references the next Node in the stack, but does not reference its previous.

 represents a first-in, first out collection of object. It is used when you need a first-in, first-out access of items. When you add an item in the list, it is called enqueue, and when you remove an item, it is called dequeue .

 ## Challenge

Using a Linked List as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement both a Stack and a Queue

## Approach & Efficiency

1. Big O for stack:

- Push O(1)
- Pop O(1)
- Peek O(1)
- IsEmpty O(1)

2. Big O for Queue:

- Enqueue O(1)
- Dequeue O(1)
- Peek    O(1)
- IsEmpty O(1)

## API

- Push: for insert new node 
- Pop: for delete a node from my linked list
- Peek: It is show me the last node add it to linked list
- IsEmpty: TO check if there is node in the linked list
- Enqueue:for insert new node
- Dequeue:for delete a node from my linked list
- Peek:  It is show me the last node add it to linked list
- IsEmpty: TO check if there is node in the linked list
