# Binary Search

Description:

Write a method called BinarySearch which takes in 2 parameters: a sorted array and the search key. Without utilizing any of the built-in methods available to your language, return the index of the array element that is equal to the search key, or -1 if the element does not exist.

## Approach & Efficiency

Big O Time = O(log n) // Big O Space = O(1)
The iterative approach to binary search comes with a logn time because the array is continually being divided in half after every comparison.
