# Trees

Binary Tree is a subset of Graph data structure used for data storage purposes. A binary tree has a special condition that each node can have at most two children, usually called Left and Right

## Challenge

Using a Trees as the underlying data storage mechanism, implement tree and binary tree.

## Approach & Efficiency

- Big O for Add is O(n)

- Big O for preorder is O(n)

- Big O for inorder is O(n)

- Big O for postorder is O(n)

- Big O for Containts is  O(log n)





## API

Add function : to add new node to our tree

search function : to search about a value in our tree 

preorder function : to oreder our node in the tree like root-left-right

inorder function : to oreder our node in the tree like left-root-right

postorder function :  to oreder our node in the tree like left-right-root
