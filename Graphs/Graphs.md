# Graphs
A graph is a non-linear data structure that can be viewed as a collection of vertices (or nodes) potentially connected by line segments named edges. This app demonstrates how a graph and its nodes are created, as well as how nodes are linked together.

## Challenge
Implement your own Graph.

## Approach & Efficiency
- Big O Space = O(n)
- Big O Time = O(n)

## API
- AddNode()

Adds a node to the graph.
- AddEdge()

Adds an edge to a node which connects to another node or itself, and includes a weight value.
- GetNodes()

Returns a list of nodes within the graph.
- GetNeighbors()

Returns a list of neighbors of a given node, including the weight of each edge between them.
- Size()

Returns a count of all the nodes in a graph.
